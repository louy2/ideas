# Free Private Email without PGP

## Inspiration
- TLS in transit is pretty common among email providers.
- PGP is hard to use
- Free domain names are available
- Automated SSL certificate refresh by Let's Encrypt

## Ideas
- Make provider-to-provider encryption end-to-end
- Empower individuals to become own provider
- Only delegate receiving encrypted email

## Caveats
- No web of trust
- Client dependent (browser extension or standalone)
